# LinearASM
A matrix calculator using functions built in NASM assembly language.

A C++ file handles matrix memory allocation and runs the assembly functions as test cases on the various matrices.

The functions currently implemented in the NASM file are a function to print a matrix, a function to add a matrix to another matrix, a function to subtract a matrix from another matrix, and a function to multiply two matrices together.
